git version (follows mageia-theme versioning and releases):
- Merge versioning back into that of mageia-theme
- Fix 16:9 reference resolution for Mageia 6 artwork (3840x2160)
- Use monitor-edid directly instead of monitor-probe, as the latter falls
  back to monitor-probe-using-X which is broken (mga#15896)
- Make sure to default to 4:3 aspect ratio if monitor-edid fails (previous
  fix was incomplete)
- Fix exit value when symlink is already correct

Version 0.7 (2015-05-02):
- Make mga-bg-res a systemd service
- Uses monitor-probe to find the optimal resolution when X is not yet started
- Handle cases where monitor-probe fails by defaulting to 4:3 aspect ratio
- Package mga-bg-res directly in mageia-theme

Version 0.6 (2015-04-22):
- xinit script: Work also when default.jpg symlink is missing

Version 0.5 (2015-03-05):
- xinit script: Adapt list of available resolutions to the new set.

Version 0.4 (2015-03-05):
- xinit script: Handle resolutions that are not directly provided
  in mageia-theme but have the same aspect ratio as provided images
  o Nothing is done is the symlink is already correct
  o Calculate aspect ratio for input resolution and link to the provided
    picture with the nearest aspect ratio (Â±0.025).

Version 0.3 (2015-02-13):
- Add support for any screen resolution that fits an aspect ratio
  provided in mageia-theme (Akien)
